## Credit-card transaction disputes, provisional credit, and dispute history

Bundle id: `credit_card_transaction_disputes`

Construction context (guidance for transcript induction, not section
content -- do not extract as policy facts): the shared banking handbook
governs identity verification, explicit customer confirmation before
account-modifying actions, discoverable-tool wrapper behavior, schema
limits, and exact transfer wording. Express these behaviorally in
transcripts where a case exercises them; do not restate them as section
facts. The bundle id, transcript focus, losslessness risks, and shared
context paths in this file are construction metadata, not policy facts.

Transcript focus:
Finding card numbers, filing transaction disputes, deciding provisional-credit eligibility, checking dispute history, and deciding when replacement is needed.

Losslessness risks:
- Preserve provisional-credit eligibility cases and exclusions.
- Preserve dispute-history lookup requirements.
- Do not let card-number retrieval replace identity verification from shared context.

### doc_credit_cards_credit_cards_(general)_015: Provisional Credit Eligibility Guidelines (Internal)

### Overview
When processing a credit card transaction dispute, you must determine whether the customer is eligible for provisional credit. Provisional credit means the disputed amount is temporarily credited back to the customer's account while the investigation is ongoing.

### Eligibility Criteria — Customer is ELIGIBLE for provisional credit if ALL of the following are true:
1. Account Standing: The customer's credit card account has been open for at least 60 days
2. Dispute Reason Category: The dispute reason is one of the following:
   - 'unauthorized_fraudulent_charge'
   - 'duplicate_charge'
   - 'goods_services_not_received' (only if purchase was made more than 30 days ago)
3. Dispute Amount: The transaction amount must be at least $25.00 and must not exceed the card's maximum provisional credit limit based on card tier (see below)
4. Previous Disputes: The customer has not filed more than 2 disputes in the past 12 months
5. Contacted Merchant: For non-fraud disputes (anything other than 'unauthorized_fraudulent_charge'), the customer must have attempted to resolve with the merchant first

### Maximum Provisional Credit Limits by Card Tier
- Entry Tier (Bronze Rewards Card, EcoCard, Business Bronze Rewards Card, Crypto-Cash Back Card): Maximum $2500.00
- Mid Tier (Silver Rewards Card, Business Silver Rewards Card, Green Rewards Card, Silver Zoom Card): Maximum $5000.00
- Premium Tier (Gold Rewards Card, Business Gold Rewards Card): Maximum $10000.00
- Elite Tier (Platinum Rewards Card, Business Platinum Rewards Card): Maximum $15000.00
- Invitation Tier (Diamond Elite Card): Maximum $25000.00

### NOT Eligible Scenarios
- Account is less than 60 days old
- Dispute reason is 'incorrect_amount', 'goods_services_not_as_described', 'canceled_subscription_still_charging', or 'refund_never_processed'
- Transaction amount is under $25.00 or exceeds the card's maximum limit based on tier
- For non-fraud disputes: customer did not contact merchant first
- 'goods_services_not_received' where purchase was made within the last 30 days (merchant may still be processing delivery)

### doc_credit_cards_credit_cards_(general)_016: Checking User Dispute History (Internal)

### Summary

To retrieve a user's credit card dispute history, use the get_user_dispute_history_7291 tool. Call it with the user's user_id to get a list of all disputes filed by that user, including dispute dates, statuses, and transaction details.

### When to Use

- You need a consolidated list of all credit card disputes filed by a specific user.
- You are reviewing the current status or historical progression of a user’s disputes.
- You need transaction-level context for each dispute.

### Required Input

- user_id (required): The user’s canonical internal identifier.

Tip: Ensure you are using the correct and current user_id before making the call.

### Procedure

1. Obtain the user_id for the user whose dispute history you need to review.
2. Invoke the tool with the user_id parameter.
3. Review the returned list of disputes and associated transaction details.

Example invocation (pseudocode):
```
result = get_user_dispute_history_7291(user_id="<user_id>")
```

### Expected Output

- A list of dispute records for the specified user.
- Each record includes:
  - Dispute identifiers and metadata:
    - dispute_id
    - dispute_date
    - status (for example: open, under_review, closed)
    - last_updated_at
  - Transaction details related to the dispute:
    - transaction_id
    - transaction_date
    - merchant_name
    - amount
    - currency
    - card_last4
  - Additional dispute context (if available):
    - reason_code
    - outcome
    - notes or internal comments

Example response shape (illustrative):
```
[
  {
    "dispute_id": "<dispute_id>",
    "dispute_date": "<timestamp>",
    "status": "<status>",
    "last_updated_at": "<timestamp>",
    "transaction": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "transaction_date": "<timestamp>",
      "merchant_name": "<merchant>",
      "amount": "<amount>",
      "currency": "<currency>",
      "card_last4": "<last4>"
    },
    "reason_code": "<reason>",
    "outcome": "<outcome>",
    "notes": "<internal_notes>"
  }
]
```

### Interpreting Results

- Verify the list is complete for the user_id you queried.
- Use dispute_date and last_updated_at to understand timeline and recency.
- Use status to determine whether action is needed.
- Review transaction details to confirm the disputed transaction context.

### Error Handling and Troubleshooting

- Empty result set:
  - The user has not filed any credit card disputes, or the user_id is incorrect.
  - Confirm you are using the correct user_id and try again.
- Permission or access error:
  - Ensure you have the necessary internal privileges to view dispute histories.
- Invalid or malformed user_id:
  - Validate the format of user_id and reissue the request.
- Partial or truncated data:
  - Retry the call.
  - If the issue persists, capture the request context and escalate through internal support channels.

### Operational Notes

- This tool returns only credit card disputes associated with the specified user_id.
- Always handle user data in accordance with internal data handling and privacy requirements.
